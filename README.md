# bird game

i like birds, and i like wizards, so why not put them together

## that's nice but what is it?

mostly spaghetti

## but what *is* it?

3D, game maker studio 1, kind of big, shaky collision detection, includes some kind of map editor and scripting system. it won't compile out of the box though because i was halfway through overhauling the game data system when i got bored.

## some things are missing

the 3D model files are really big (currently 270 mb total) and i don't know if github imposes a size limit on free repositories so i didn't include them, i'll probably get around to hosting them separately on google drive or something later, or find a way to compress them so they don't take up as much space

## this hasn't been worked on since august 2018

but i'll get back to it eventually i swear, although parts of it probably need re-writing to become less spaghetti
